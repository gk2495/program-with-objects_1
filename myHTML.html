    <h2>Stage 0: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
    <div class="art">
      <h4>The World Wide Web</h4>
      <p>
        The <b><em>World Wide Web</em></b> was developed in the early 1990s and has around 30 billion pages. The <b><em> World Wide Web</em></b> is a collection of HTML documents. These documents are made up of HTML. Click the following link to

      <h4>Web Concept</h4>
      <p>
        The major pieces of the web are you, your computer running a web browser, the internet, and servers. When you go to a web page your computer sends a HTTP request to a server. The server gets the HTML document and sends it back to the user where a web browser interprets the page and displays it. Click the following link to

     <h4>HTML Basics</h4>
    <p>
      <b><em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em></b> is the basis for almost every webpage. HTML is the main type of document on the web. It is what glues everything together such as documents, images, and videos. There are many types of files that can be found on the web such as Plain text, HTML, Images, Videos, and Music.Click the following link to 
      <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48230539/m-48742046">Review Lesson</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML is made up of Text content (what you see), Markup (what it looks like), reference to other documents (like images and videos), and links to other pages. Click the following link to

    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>HTML Markup, Tags, Attributes, Elements</h4>
    <p>
      HTML Markup is made up of <b><em>Tags</em></b>. Opening Tags are different from Closing Tags in that Closing Tags have a (/) in front of them. Some examples of tags are &lt;b&gt; = bold and &lt;em&gt; = italic tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tags can have multiple <b><em>Attributes</em></b>. An example of a tag that uses an <b>Attribute</b> is the &lt;a&gt; tag = Anchor tag.  The &lt;a&gt; tag can use<em>( href=)</em> to create a hyperlink. Another tag that can use an Attribute is the &lt;img&gt; tag.  The &lt;img&gt; tag uses <em>(src=)</em> also known as URL.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML documents are made of elements. An <b><em>Element</em></b> can be looked as a individual component of an HTML document. Click the following link to

    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>Inline vs Block</h4>
    <p>
      <b><em>Block</em></b> elements normally start with a new line. Can have height and width "invisable boxes"  Examples: &lt;h1&gt;,  &lt;p&gt;, and  &lt;div&gt;.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><em>Inline</em></b> elements are normally displayed without line breaks. Examples:  &lt;br&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, and &lt;span&gt;.

     <h4>Stupid Computers</h4>
    <p>
      Computers are "stupid" because they interpret instructions or what we code literally.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
     <h4>5 Most Important Things To Take</h4>
    <p>
      <b>1. What is a webpage?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A webpage is a "<em>text document</em>" written in a language called HTML.  Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. How coding works.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Computers are stupid.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Programmers need to write <em>exactly</em> the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Programmers cant remember everything</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are too many details to keep in your head. You can always look it up. :)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Basic HTML vocabulary</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tag</b>: an HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Some tags called "void tags" do not require a closing tag like &lt;br&gt;.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Element</b>: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of openings and closing tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Atribute</b>: This is a property of an HTML element.
    </p>

  <div class="stageart">
    <h2>Stage 1: Webpages, Documents, and Structure</h2>
    <div class="art">
     <h4>HTML, CSS, and DOM</h4>
     <p>
      <b>HTML</b> - Hyper Text Markup Language - the standard markup language used to create web pages.  HTML controls the structure of a webpage.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>CSS</b> - Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.  CSS controls the Style of a webpage.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>DOM</b> - Document Object Model - a cross- platform and language independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML.  The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>DIV and SPAN</h4>
    <p>
      <b>&lt;Div&gt;</b> - &lt;div&gt; tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.  The &lt;div&gt; tag is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>&lt;Span&gt;</b> - The &lt;span&gt; tag is used to group inline-elements in a document.  The &lt;span&gt; tag provides no visual change by itself.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
     <h4>CSS</h4>
        <p>
      CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a  markup language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Order matters with styles.  Styles can be defined in different places and are applied in the following order the default style of a browser, stylesheet in a a seperate file, stylesheet inside HTML, and inline style in an element.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
     <h4>Avoiding Repetition</h4>
        <p>
      When writing code you want to avoid repetition.  Repetition will increase your likelihood of creating errors while also making your code harder to read.  A benefit of avoiding repetition in code would be efficiency in production.  Using CSS can assist with avoiding repetition. CSS enables the seperation of document content from document presentation which can reduce complexity and repetition.
    </p>
   </div>
  <div class="art">
     <h4>The Box Model</h4>
    <p>
      Boxes consist of the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Content</b> - image or test that appears on the website.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Padding</b> - clears an area around the content effected by the "backround color" of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Border</b> - is inherited by the color property of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Margin</b> - Clears area around the border and is transparent.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>Adding Images</h4>
    <p>
      You can add an image to a page with the tag &lt;img&gt;.  When using an image you should also remember to use the "alt" attribute which displays alternate information to the screen incase the browser cannot display the image. An example is here &lt;img src="img/app.png" alt="This is a screenshot"&gt;
  </p>
 </div>
  <div class="art">
   <h4>Code, Test, Refine</h4>
  <p>
    The simple pattern to follow when designing a page.
  </p>
  <p>
    1. Look for natural boxes.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Look for repeated styles and semantic elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Write your HTML.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Apply Styles (from BIGGEST to smallest)
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Fix things

  <h2>Stage 2 Section 1: Telling Computers What To Do</h2>
<div class="art">
  <h4>Computer Programming and Computer Science</h4>
  <p>
    <b>Computer Programming</b> - is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Computer Science</b> - is the study of computers and their architecture, languages, and applications, in all aspects, as well as the mathematical structures that relate to computers and computation.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="art">
  <h4>Programming Language</h4>
  <p>
    <b>Programming Language</b> is a formal constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer.  Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.
  </p>
</div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>Backus-Naur Form</h4> 
    <p>
      The purpose of Backus Naur Form is to precisely describe exactly the language in a way thats very simple and concise.  BNF is often used to describe the syntax of languages used in computing, such as computer programming languages, document formats, instruction sets and communication protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>non-terminal -> replacement -> terminal</em>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
  <h4>Python</h4>
  <p>
    <b>Python</b> is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.  <b>Python interpreter</b> is a program that reads Python programs and carries out their instructions.
  </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class= "stageart">
  <h2>Stage 2 Section 2: Variables and Strings</h2>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>The Variable</h4>
    <p>
      <b>1. What is a Variable?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A symbolic name for (or reference to) information.  The variable's name represents what information the variable contains.  In Python you can use a variable to create a name and use the name to reer to a variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Variables can vary in that it will refer to the most recent value given to the referenced variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.What does it mean to assign a value to a variable?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      It means to symbolically associate a specific piece of information with a name.  Any operations that are applied to this "name" (or variable) must hold true for any possible values.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.What is the difference between what the equals (=) means in math versus in programming?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In math = is used for equality or sum where in coding it means assignment.  Think of it as an arrow &lt;-.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>Strings</h4>
    <p>
      A <b>String</b> is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes.  Ex: 'i am a string'.  Double quotes can be used but must begin and end with double quotes.  Ex: "i perfer to use double quote!"
    </p>
    <p>
      You can concatenate 2 strings using the + operator.  You cannot concatenate a string and an integer. You can also multiply strings using the *.
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>Index Strings</h4>
      <p>
        You can extract subsequences from a string by indexing.  Using the square brackets [] after a string will enable you to extract parts of that string.  The characters of a string are indexed starting with the leftmost character being 0 and ascending (left to right).  The characters can also be selected from the rightmost starting at -1 and descending (right to left).
      </P>
      <p>
        Ex: &lt;string&gt; [&lt;expression&gt;] -&gt; one-character string
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="art">
      <h4>Selecting Sub Sequences</h4>
      <p>
        You can select subsequences from a string by creating a start and stop expression, where your starting position start and ending on position stop -1.  This will basically allow you to select a subsequence of continuous characters in a string.
      </p>
      <p>
        &lt;string&gt;[&lt;expression&gt;:&lt;expression&gt;]
      </p>
      <p>
        Word = 'assume'
      </p>
      <p>
      Word [4:6] - &gt; me
    </p>
</div>
<div class="art">
  <h4>Find Strings in String</h4>
  <p>
    The <b>Find</b> operation gives us the ability to find a substring in a big string.  Find is a procedure that works on strings.  Find gives the number of the first postion (number) in the search string where the targert string occurs.  If the number is not found it will return a -1.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ex: Pythagoras = 'There is a geometry in the humming of the strings, there is music in the spacing of the spheres.'
  </p>
  <p>
    print pythagoras.find ('string') = 40
  </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="stageart">
  <h2>Stage 2 Session 3: Input &gt; Function &gt; Output</h2>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>Function</h4>
    <p>
      A <b>Function</b> is a type of procedure or routine.  Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value.  Inputs can also be refered to as operands or arguments.
    </p>
  </div>
    <div class="art">
    <h4>The Difference Between Making and Using a Function</h4>
    <p>
      When you <b>Make</b> a function you define a procedure or code block to perform a task.  Ex: def sum(x,x):.  When you <b>Use</b> a funciton you call on a particular procedure previously defined.  Ex: print sum(x,x).
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>How Functions Help Programmers Avoid Repetition</h4>
    <p>
      Functions help programmers avoid repetition in that when there are some type of operation or calculation to be repeated numerous times. We can define it as a function or procedure and then call on it as needed.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>A Function Without a Return Statement</h4>
    <p>
      A <b>Return Statement</b> causes your function to exit and hands back a value to its caller.  If the return statement is not used the output value will be <b>None</b>.
    </p>
  </div>
  </div>
    <div class="stageart">
      <h2>Stage 2 Session 4: Control Flow and Loops</h2>
      <div class="art">
        <h4>Boolean</h4>
          <p>
            Boolean expressions are expressions that result in the value of either TRUE or FALSE.  Boolean consist of operators such as AND, OR, and NOT.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="art">
          <h4>If and Else</h4>
            <p>
              <b>IF</b> is a statement used to make comparison.  You make your code do something different based on the rsults of the comparison.  IF statement can be followed by and else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
              </p>
              <p>
              An <b>else</b> statement contains the block of code that executes if the conditional expression in the IF statement resolves to 0 or a false value.
              </p>
              <p>
              Ex: if &lt;testexpression&gt;:
              <br>
              &lt;block&gt;
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="art">
          <h4>OR</h4>
            <p>
              If the first expression evlauates to True, the value is true and the second expression is not evaluated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ex: print True or False - Value is True.
              </p>
              <p>
                if the first expression evaluates to False, the value is the value of the second expression.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ex: print False or False - Value is False.
              </p>
            </div>
          <div class="art">
          <h4>Comparison Operators</h4>
          <p>
            <b>==</b> Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>!=</b> Checks if the value of tow operands are equal or not, if the values are not equal then the condition becomes true.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>&lt;</b> Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>&gt;</b> Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the vaule of the right operand, if yes then the condition becomes true.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="art">
          <h4>While Loops</h4>
          <p>
            A <b>While</b> loop statement in Python repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ex: while &lt;testexpression&gt;:
            <br>
             &lt;block&gt;
            </p>
            <p>
              Break statement gives us a way to stop the loop even when test condition is true.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ex: while &lt;testexpression&gt;:
            <br>
              &lt;code&gt;
            <br>
              if&lt;breaktest&gt;:
            <br>
              break
            <br>
            &lt;morecode&gt;
            <br>
            &lt;afterwhile&gt;
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="art">
          <h4>Debugging</h4>
        <p>
          <b>Traceback</b> tells you what line code crashed on, what file it was running, and how it got there.  The information given especially the line number and function name can focus your attention on the line of code that maybe going wrong.  Even if it is not on the line given it is upstream of that line.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Print</b> statements can be used to assist with finding bugs but remember to remove them when finished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Debugging isn't just correcting errors, it is a scientific process of examing code to discover things you didn't expect in it.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="art">
          <h4>Debugging Strategies</h4>
          <p>
        <b>1. Examine error messages when programs crash.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
      The last line of Python Tracebacks will tell you what went wrong. Reading backwards from there will tell you more about where the problem occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
         <b>2. Work from example code.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
     If your modified code doesn't work, comment it out and do step-by-step modifications to the example code until it does what you want.
   </p>
   <p>
        <b>3. Make sure examples work.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
     Just because you find example code doesn't mean it will work in your system. Check the example code you're using to make sure it behaves the way you expect.
   </p>
   <p>
        <b>4. Check (print) intermediate results.</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
      When your code doesn't crash, but doesn't behave as expected, add print statements to your program to see where in the code things stop behaving correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Keep and compare old versions</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you have a working version of your code, save it before you add to the code. This will give you something to go back to if you introduce too many new bugs.
    </p>
  </div>

<div class="stageart">
  <h2>Stage 2 Session 4: Lists and For Loops</h2>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>Difference in List and Strings</h4>
    <p>
      The difference between <b>strings</b> and list is tha strings you are limited to sequence of characters where a <b>list</b> is a sequence of anything.  List are more powerful than strings, where in string all the elements had to be characters, in a list the elements can be anything like characters, strings, numbers, and other lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ex list: p = ['y','a','b','b','a','!']
    </p>
    <p>
      Ex list: p[2:4] = ['b','b'] (instead of returning a string it returns a list)
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>Mutation</h4>
    <p>
      A <b>Mutation</b> is the ability to change the value of a list after it has been created.
    </p>
    <p>
      So if you had the following list p = ['H','E','L','L','O'] you could replace the <b>H</b> with a <b>Y</b> by changing the first character using p[0] = 'Y'.  The [0] indicates what positon H is referenced.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>Aliasing</h4>
    <p>
    <b>Aliasing</b> is when you have two different ways to refer to the same object.
  </p>
  <p>
    The example given is like James Bond you have 2 ways of refering to that person.  You can refer to that person by his name James Bond or his code name 007.  The same idea applies where if you change either one it will change the other.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="art">
  <h4>Append</h4>
  <p>
    <b>Append</b> is a method that will add a new element to the end of a list.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ex: &lt;list&gt;.append(&lt;element&gt;)
  </p>
</div>
<div class="art">
  <h4>Plus (+)</h4>
  <p>
    The plus is similar to concatenation in that it will combined two list together.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="art">
  <h4>Length</h4>
    <p>
      Length function will return the number of items in a list.  If you have levels of list within a list such as when you append a list to an existing list, the appended list will count as one position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ex: len(&lt;list&gt;)
    </p>
    <p>
      Ex: len([0,1]) will return 2
    </p>
    <p>
      Ex: len([0,1,[2,3]]) will return 3
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>Append vs Plus</h4>
    <p>
      Append will keep the levels of the lists or in other words insert a list as a new position in an existing list.  While Plus will join the two list or add one list to another.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>For Loop</h4>
    <p>
      A simple way for python to loop through elements on a list is by using the function <b>For loop</b>.  This will basically repeat a specific block of code for each element in a list. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Ex: for&lt;name&gt;in&lt;list&gt;:
  </p>
  <p>
    &lt;block&gt;
  </p>
</div>
<div class="art">
  <h4>Index</h4>
  <p>
    <b>Index</b> is similar to .find.  If the value is in the list, returns the first position where the value is found in the list otherwise produces an error.
  </p>
  <p>
    &lt;list&gt;.index(&lt;value&gt;)
  </p>
</div>
<div class="art">
  <h4>In and Not In</h4>
  <p>
    <b>In</b> Evaluates to true if it finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise.  <b>Not In</b> Evaluates to true if it does not find a variable in the specific sequence and false otherwise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ex: &lt;value&gt; in &lt;list&gt;
  </p>
  <p>
    Ex: &lt;value&gt; not in &lt;list&gt;
  </p>
</div>

  <h2>Stage 3 Session 1: Use Functions</h2>
<div class="art">
    <h4>import</h4>
    <p>
      The <b>import</b> statement allows us to use modules and all of its functionality in our program.  It will import the module X, and creates a reference to that module in the current namespace.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="art">
    <h4>webbrowser</h4>
    <p>
     The webbrowser module includes functions to open URLS in interactive browser applications. The open() function will display the URL using default browser.  It accepts an URL as the argument.  The webbrowser module can also be thought of as a file in the Python Standard Library and open can be viewed as a function within that file.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="art">
    <h4>time</h4>
    <p>
      The time module provides various time-related functions. For example the time module has a handy function called sleep().  Essentially, as the name implies, it pauses your Python program.  It accepts the number of seconds the Python program should pause execution as its argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time module also has a function .ctime() that convert a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a string representing local time.
    </p>
  </div>
    <div class="art">
      <h4>What is Abstraction?</h4>
      <p>
      Even though we dont't know how things like functions work behind the scenes we can read their documentation and use them without error.  Hiding of detail behind documentation is called abstraction in computer programming.
    </p>
  </div>
    <div class="art">
      <h4>os</h4>
      <p>
        The os module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.  Os can also be thought of as a file in the Python Standard Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        The listdir() function returns a list containing the names of the entries in the directory given by path.  listdir() takes a path as its argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rename() function renames the file or directory src to dst.  It takes the source (src) or current name of the file and changes it to the destination (dst) or new name of the file.
      </p>
      <p>
        The getcwd() will return a string in the current working directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The os.chdir(path) will chang the current working directory to path.
      </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Stage 3 Session 2: Use Classes-DrawTurtles</h2>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>What is a Class?</h4>
      <p>
        A class is a way to take a grouping of functions and data and place them inside a container so you can access them with the . (dot) operator.  Using classes, you can add consistency to your programs so that they can be used in a cleaner way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Classes can also be viewed as a neatly packaged box that puts things together really well and it allows us to write code like turtle.Turtle().  An example of a class would be Turtle it contains certain pieces of information about a turtle: the turtle's size, its color, the fact that the Turtle can move foward.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="art">
    <h4>turtle</h4>
      <p>
        The turtle module provides a method of programming vector graphics using a relative cursor (the "turtle") upon a Cartesian plane.  It was part of the original Logo programming language developed by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966.  It is called Turtle because Turtle graphics is a popular way of intruducing programming to children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the Python Standard Library there is a file called turtle.   Inside that file there is a class Turtle. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Turtle is a Subclass of RawTurtle, has the same interface but draws on a default screen object created automatically when neeeded for the first time.  The () in turtle.Turtle() calls a function __init__ which is defined inside the class Turtle.  
      </p>
      <p>
        __init__ stands for initialize which creates space in memory for a new instance or object of the class Turtle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once an instance such as turtle.Turtle() is assigned a name (brad=turtle.Turtle()), brad can now access all the other methods inside class Turtle such as foward and right.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="art">
    <h4>Difference in webbrowser.open() and turtle.Turtle()</h4>
      <p>
       Although it may appear that you call a function in both cases they differ.  When we call webbrowser.open() you are simply calling a function open. When we call turtle.Turtle() it instead calls the __init__ function defined inside class Turtle.
      </p>
    </div>

  <div class="stageart">
  <h2>Stage 3 Session 2: Use Classes-Send Text</h2>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>What are keywords?</h4>
      <p>
        Keywords in Python are reserved words that cannot be used as ordinary identifiers.  They must be spelled exactly as they are written.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="art">
      <h4>What does the keyword from mean?</h4>
      <p>
        Python's from statement lets you import specific attributes from a module into the current namespace.  ex: from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="art">
      <h4>What is an instance of a class?</h4>
      <p>
        If Fish is a class then an instance of a class would be a Salmon.  Where the Salmon can take on attributes or methods of Fish.  For instance brad = turtle.Turtle().  When we call turtle.Turtle() it calls the __init__function definded inside class Turtle.  the __init__ function then creates space in memory for a new instance or object brad. Brad is an instance of the class Turtle.  Brad can do things defind in class turtle such as foward().

  <div class="art">
    <h4>Built-in Functions</h4>
      <p>
        Built into the Python interpreter are a number of functions (pieces of code that carry out specific operations and return the results of those operations).  For instance the function open returns an object of the file type. ex: quotes = open(file_location)
      </p>
    </div>

  <h2>Stage 3 Session 3: Make Classes-Movie Website</h2>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>Class keyword</h4>
      <p>
        The Class keyword allows us to make classes. It is used to create new user defined objects.  A Class can be thought of as a blueprint that can use data and methods.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="art">
    <h4>instances of a class</h4>
      <p>
        As defined in our last session when we used an instance of class when making the movie website the example given is toy_story = media.Movie().  Where toy_story is an instance of the class Movie.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="art">
    <h4>Constructor</h4>
      <p>
        The constructor is essentially the __init__ method inside the Class.  The first method __init__() is a special method, which is called class constructor or initialization method that Python calls when you create a new instance of this class. You declare other class methods like normal functions with the exception that the first argument to each method is self.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="art">
    <h4>Instance Variables</h4>
      <p>
        Is a variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.  Also it can be viewed as all of the variables associated to a specific instance are instance variables.
        <br>
        ex: def __init__(self, movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image, trailer_youtube):
        <br>
        self.title = movie_title and self.storyline = movie_storyline would be instance variables.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="art">
    <h4>Instance Methods</h4>
      <p>
        All of the functions inside a class that are associated with an instance and have the first argument as self are called instance methods.
        <br>
        ex: def show_trailer(self):
        <br>
        webbrowser.open(self.trailer_youtube_url)
      </p>

  </div>
  <div class="stageart">
  <h2>Stage 3 Session 3: Make Classes-Advanced Topic</h2>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>Class variable</h4>
      <p>
        In object-oriented programming with classes, a class variable is a variable defined in a class of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist. A class variable is not an instance variable.  Class variables can be manually created or can come by default.  Examples of Python classes that come by default or predefined are __doc__, __name__, and __module__. 
      </p>
    </div> 
    <div class="art">
    <h4>Inheritance</h4>
      <p>
       Inheritance is a powerful feature in object oriented programming. It refers to defining a new class with little or no modification to an existing class. The new class is called derived (or child) class and the one from which it inherits is called the base (or parent) class. Derived class inherits features from the base class, adding new features to it. This results into re-usability of code.      </p>
    </div>
     <div class="art">
    <h4>Method Overriding</h4>
      <p>
        The problem with having functions called implicitly is sometimes you want the child to behave differently. In this case you want to override the function in the child, effectively replacing the functionality. To do this just define a function with the same name in Child.      
      </p>
    </div>
     <div class="art">
    <h4>What is Object Oriented Programming(OOP)?</h4>
      <p>
        A type of programming in which programmers define not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure. In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another. For example, objects can inherit characteristics from other objects. One of the principal advantages of object-oriented programming techniques over procedural programming techniques is that they enable programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when a new type of object is added. A programmer can simply create a new object that inherits many of its features from existing objects.
      </p>
    </div>
      <div class="art">
    <h4>Is there any similarity between HTML/CSS class and the class concept we talk in OOP?</h4>
      <p>
        HTML/CSS classes can be similar to the class concepts we talk about in OOP.  We can use the block level element &lt;div&gt; to group like data and then use the class attribute to point to a class in a style sheet. Then in CSS the .class selector styles all elements with the specified class. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="art">
    <h4>Can we apply inheritance and method overriding concepts to HTML/CSS as well?</h4>
      <p>
       Inheritance is a key feature in CSS, it relies on the parent-child relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its children.  Child elements may inherit CSS property values from any Parent element enclosing them.  Inheritance prevents certain properties from being declared over and over again in a style sheet, allowing the software developers to write less CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ex: h1 { 
        <br>
        color: pink;
        <br>}
        <br>
        If there is an h1 elemenet with an emphasizing element (em) inside:
        <br>
        <br>
        This is to &lt;em&gt;illustrate&lt;/em&gt; inheritance
        <br>
        <br>
        If no color has been assigned to the em element, the emphasized word "illustrate" will inherit the color of the parent element, h1. The style sheet h1 has the color pink, hence, the em element will likewise be in pink.
      </p>
      <p>
        Method Overriding can be used in HTML/CSS.  The word "cascading" in CSS describes a cascading mechanism; that is to say that the CSS code on the page itself will override the CSS code in a separate linked file. And subsequently, CSS declared "inline" on the tag itself would override all other CSS.
